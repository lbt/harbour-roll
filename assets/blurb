Description:

There are a variety of different dice shapes and 3D Dice remembers the set you're using each time.

Probably the most active "Active Cover" in the store - check the options  :)

'Fancy Lights' makes the lights move around; 'Change Colours' when you want some variety.

Want to chill? Turn off gravity and watch them float (hint: they make brilliant Ambiences with screenshot)

One comment: do be careful as it uses a lot of CPU so it eats your battery whilst it's active (it's fine when it's minimised though).

Summary

3D Dice simulation with fancy lighting - it's surprising how much fun it can be! Try and stack them or just watch them fall!

Recent Changes:

Now with different shaped dice - 8, 10, 12 and 20 sided; and slightly better lighting too.

Touch the dice to remove them - they glow and then vanish !

3D Dice now remembers the set you were using each time.

Changed the 'Fly' mode to let you actually fly past the dice.

There's a brief splash screen and the menu shows when it starts because some users missed that feature - let me know if it gets annoying.

Also - don't forget to 'Like' the apps that you like best (and I hope 3D Dice is one of them) :)

0.4 has a tiny change to fix a bug/crash for people using debug builds of Qt - Thanks for telling me Niels :)
