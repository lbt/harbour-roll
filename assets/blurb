Description:

Dice is a 3D dice throwing simulator - it's surprising how much fun it can be! Try and stack them or just watch them fall!

Tap on the page title for help and more options.

'Fancy Lights' makes the lights move around; 'Change Colours' when you want some variety :)

Want to chill? Turn off gravity and watch them float (hint: they make good Ambiences with screenshot)

One comment: do be careful as it uses a lot of CPU so it eats your battery whilst it's active (it's fine when it's minimised though).


Summary
3D dice simulation with fancy lighting - good fun as a puzzle too


Recent Changes:
The cover now shows the dice - and there's a new option to keep running when minimised for a truly "Active Cover".
Fixed a small bug in the 'Gravity' menu item and added scroll indicators.
The invisible box the dice live in is smaller so if you hold the phone above you you can still seem them.

There's a brief splash screen and the menu shows when it starts because some users missed that feature - let me know if it gets annoying.

Also - don't forget to 'Like' the apps that you like best (and I hope 3D Dice is one of them) :)
